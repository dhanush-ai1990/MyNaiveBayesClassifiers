# MyNaiveBayesClassifiers
Non Scikit learn Implementation of Naive Bayes in Python


Data : Twenty News group

Implementation :

1) To study the Effect of additive smoothing for Naive bayes Classifier - Bernoulli
2) To study the effect of additive smooting for Multinomial Bayes Classifier

Bayes.py - Implementation of both Classifiers( Non scikit learn and traditional way - Counting words, taking negative log probablities)

      - Also varies smoothing parameter alpha from 0.01 till 1.0 with increments of 0.01.
      - plots to show accuracy vs alpha.
      
      

Code can be reused for any dataset.
